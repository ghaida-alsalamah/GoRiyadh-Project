        "## Introduction  \n",
        "This notebook presents a detailed analysis to determine the suitable machine learning model type (Regression or Classification) for each dataset in the GoRiyadh project. Based on the exploratory data analysis performed in Task 2 (files: `Task_2_Hotels-2.ipynb`, `Task_2_Restaurants.ipynb`, and `GoRiyadh_Cafe_dataset_analysis.ipynb`), we will identify the target variable, propose relevant algorithms, and justify our choices.  \n",

        "- **Columns:** `hotel_id`, `hotel_name`, `price`, `base_price`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`, `count` (number of reviews), `rating`, `Info` (services), `latitude`, `longitude`.\n",
        "- **Target Variable:** `price` (nightly rate) – a continuous numerical value.\n",
        "- **Key Characteristics:**\n",
        "  - Missing values in `price` (~1.3%) and in geographic coordinates (~9%).\n",
        "  - Outliers present (luxury hotels with extremely high prices).\n",
        "  - Rating distribution: 49.1% of hotels have a rating of 4.5, with ratings ranging from 2.5 to 5.\n",
        "  - Review counts vary from 1 to 1626.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Type: **Regression**  \n",
        "Because the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (price) based on features like location, rating, and services.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proposed Algorithms\n",
        "- **Linear Regression** – A simple, interpretable baseline model.\n",
        "- **Random Forest Regressor** – Handles non-linear relationships, reduces overfitting, and provides feature importance.\n",
        "- **XGBoost Regressor** – High predictive accuracy, robust to missing values, and effective with mixed data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Justification\n",
        "- The presence of outliers and variability in prices favors ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) that are less sensitive to extreme values.\n",
        "- Geographic features (latitude/longitude) can be leveraged to capture location-based price trends.\n",
        "- Linear regression serves as a quick benchmark to evaluate more complex models."

        "  - `Unknown` (10.4%)  \n",
        "  - `Expensive` (2.1%)  \n",
        "  - `Very Expensive` (0.5%)  \n",
        "- **Key Characteristics:**\n",
        "  - Significant class imbalance (Cheap and Moderate dominate).\n",
        "  - Missing values in `rating` and `ratingsSignals` (~59% missing).\n",
        "  - Rich set of predictors: cuisine type, location, popularity metrics (likes, photos, tips), and review information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Type: **Multiclass Classification**  \n",
        "The objective is to predict the price category of a restaurant using its features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proposed Algorithms\n",
        "- **Logistic Regression (Multinomial)** – Simple and efficient for multi-class problems, provides probabilistic outputs.\n",
        "- **Random Forest Classifier** – Handles non-linear patterns, resistant to overfitting, and captures feature interactions.\n",
        "- **XGBoost Classifier** – State-of-the-art gradient boosting, supports missing values natively, and can handle class imbalance via weighted training.\n",
        "- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel** – Effective in high-dimensional spaces and when classes are not linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Justification\n",
        "- The target is categorical, so classification is the natural choice.\n",
        "- The severe class imbalance requires algorithms that can incorporate class weights or resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE).\n",
        "- XGBoost and Random Forest can automatically handle missing data in predictors.\n",
        "- The variety of feature types (numerical, categorical, spatial) makes ensemble methods particularly suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Optional Consideration\n",
        "If the price categories are later converted to ordinal numeric values (e.g., 1=Cheap, 2=Moderate, …), **Ordinal Regression** could be explored. However, given the current labels, classification remains the most appropriate approach."

        "  - `rating` (continuous, 1.0–5.0) – currently the most complete numerical feature.  \n",
        "  - **No price column** is present in the provided data.\n",
        "- **Key Characteristics:**\n",
        "  - 62% of cafes have a rating above 4.0.\n",
        "  - `rating_count` ranges up to 10,000+, with a right-skewed distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Current Objective (Price Unavailable)\n",
        "Given the absence of price information, the immediate feasible target is **rating prediction** – estimating a cafe's rating based on location, number of reviews, and 24‑hour operation. This still provides value to tourists seeking high-quality cafes.\n",

        "### Future Objective (When Price Data Becomes Available)\n",
        "Once price information is collected, the primary goal shifts to **price prediction** (also Regression), using the same algorithms. The cafe data would then align perfectly with the project's cost‑estimation theme.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Justification for Current Choice\n",
        "- Rating is a continuous variable, making regression appropriate.\n",
        "- The combination of numerical (`rating_count`), binary (`24_hours`), and spatial (`lat`, `lon`) features can be effectively modeled by tree‑based ensembles.\n",
        "- Linear regression offers a simple benchmark."
